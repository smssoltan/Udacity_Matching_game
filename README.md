## Instructions

To play this game, you will need to open https://smssoltan.github.io/Udacity_Matching_game/ in your browser. After you do so,
The game will start immediately ass soon as the page finishes to load. To win in this game,
You will have to find two cards that matches and continue to do so until you find all matching cards.
If you select two cards that are different, you will have to select another until you find the one matches
with your card. Be aware, all of your moves are being counted. And, you will be rated depending on the 
number of moves that you makes until you finish the game. If you want to reset the game, you can do so
by clicking on the Reset button on the top right.


## Requirements

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. In this project, I was required to convert this game from a static one to an interactive one. To do this, had to make small changes to the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
